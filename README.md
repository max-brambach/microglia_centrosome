# microglia_centrosome

This repository contains the code used for parts of the analysis of the paper "A role for the centrosome in regulating the rate of neuronal efferocytosis by microglia in vivo" by K. MÃ¶ller et al.

The code is organised in Jupyter notebooks that contain the speciffic code necessary to transform the raw tracking data (stored in the folder data) into the plots shown in the paper. Every notebook corresponds to one figure.
